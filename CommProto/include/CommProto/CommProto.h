   This file will be the interface for which users will include, so as to not have to figure out
   where every file is. This is for convenience, just include this file and you are done! You can
   use the library however way you wish, but with a slight drawback. Like the standard library in
   C++, you will include files that you aren't even going to use, which will result in unnecessary
   increase in executable binary size, but at least you will have the entire library at your disposal.
