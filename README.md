# CommProtocol Stable Version 1.0.6
Git hub to work on new Comm Protocol design.

## Design Goals
- Powerful
- Robust
- Adaptable

This Com Protocol should be able to handle data dynamically, without needing to be hardcoded in. This will allow programmers more flexibility to change and adapt based on the agreement from both ends of the link, without too much work on the library itself. It should be able to allow programmers to define what is needed to be sent between both parties, so that the maintainers of this library have room to optimize the library itself without having to figure out what needs to be sent.
  
Current Alpha Features:
- Cross-platform library (Linux/POSIX/Windows)
- Supports Loose Coupling.
- Allows connections via Serial and UDP.
- Designed in an Object Oriented manner to make it easier to use the library.  
  
Features currently implementing:  
- TCP, Zigbee, and WPAN implementation  
- AES Encryptions for protocol.  
- C# and JNI Wrapping for communications use.  
- Thread and Mutex redesigns.
