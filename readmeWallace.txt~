All of these files are structure in a certain way, so as to organize the library architecture, here is the layout:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Directory    | Purpose                                                 | Language |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| architecture | Intended to hold all files used for operating system    | C/C++    |
|              | checking, configuration and anything OS specific that   |          |
|              | are not necessary for dealing with in the main src.     |          |
|              | This directory will hold most of the architecture of    |          |
|              | the Communications Protocol.                            |          |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| lib          | Used for holding any libraries we may use (ex. Crypto++ | C/C++    |
|              | , xbee, etc.).                                          |          |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| tools        | Contains custom made data structures, certain generic   | C/C++    |
|              | allocators, possibly some algorithms and what not. We   |          |
|              | Will most likely not need most of this crap, but just   |          |
|              | the data structures.                                    |          |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| CommProto    | The main course of our library. Intended to hold all    | C++      |
|              | files and pipelines regarding the use of our library.   |          |
|              | Most of the important stuff is going in here, such as   |          |
|              | packing, marshalling, sending data, receiving data,     |          |
|              | encrypting, etc.                                        |          |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| build        | Will hold our .lib/.a files or .dll/.so files for use   | Machine  |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should things go right, we shouldn't need to create any scripts to generate any more messages, only have the 
separate platforms do it instead, our job is mainly to create the protocol, have it be sent securely and propely so that
GCS and all other platforms can understand it on their end, and optimize the library so that it may run efficiently.
